Knowns:
  Number of 'quartiles' = 5
  Number of tiles = 20

Permutations:
  sequence without repetition
  P(n,k) = k arrangements of n terms
  P(n, k) = n! / (n-k)!

  Words of tile length 1:
    Trivial solution, total permutations == number of tiles
    1 arrangement of 20 terms = 20! / (20-1)! = 20! / 19! = 20    

  Words of tile length 4:
    Worst case
    P(20, 4) = 20! / (20-4)! = 20! / 16! = 20 * 19 * 18 * 17 = 116,280
